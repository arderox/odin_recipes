    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>If you can't go to NY, make NY come to you.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 1/2 cups or 639g of bread flour.</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar.</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons sea salt.</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast.</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups or 340ml of lukewarm water.</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil.</li>
      <li>Pizza sauce.</li>
      <li>Mozarella.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Day Before</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl of an electric mixer add the flour, sugar salt and yeast.</li>
      <li>In a separate jug add the warm water and oil.</li>
      <li>Turn the machine on to medium speed andd the wet ingredients into the dry. Just add enough liquid for the dough to form a ball.</li>
      <li>When the dough is ready, divide the dough into three balls and place each in a container with a sealable lid. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least one day and up to 4 days. The dough can also be frozen at this stage.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Next Day</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>At least two hours before baking, remove dough from the refrigerator and allow it sit at room temperature to take the chill of it.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F and place in a pizza stoner or tray if using. Turn a dough ball out into a lightly floured surface. Gently stretch the dough by draping over your knuckles into a 12-14 inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Slide the pizza base onto a flat baking tray lined with parchment.</li>
      <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly on the surface of the crust, almost to the edge. Sprinkle cheese over sauce followed by any of your favorite pizza toppings.</li>
      <li>Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake for roughly 12-15 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown. Transfer to cutting board, slice and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
